<b> Mobile Security Education, Training, and Awareness (SETA) Artifact </b>
</p align="center">
  
Security Education, Training, and Awareness (SETA) programs are designed to enhance an organization's security posture by equipping employees with the knowledge and skills needed to recognize and address security threats, such as phishing and social engineering (Dincelli & Chengalur-Smith, 2020). However, SETA programs are often implemented using a one-size-fits-all approach that does not account for unique user characteristics (D’Arcy & Hovav, 2008) and the distinct security challenges posed by different platforms or devices (Tyagi et al., 2020). To the best of our knowledge, SETA programs specifically tailored to address mobile device security remain rare. This represents a critical gap, particularly given the growing reliance on mobile devices driven by remote work and bring-your-own-device (BYOD) trends (Patten & Harris, 2013). In both personal and professional contexts, mobile-specific threats demand specialized strategies and targeted training to ensure effective risk mitigation.

This project aims to address this gap by developing a mobile SETA artifact specifically designed to tackle the unique challenges of securing mobile devices. The mobile SETA artifact focuses on enhancing mobile security awareness and mindfulness to protect sensitive information in a mobile-first environment and addresses issues such as app permissions, mobile-specific malware, insecure networks, romance and finance scams.

To achieve this, the mobile SETA artifact engages users through an interactive, game-like experience that utilizes scenario-based training. This approach not only improves users’ awareness but also fosters mindfulness by highlighting the differences between secure and insecure behaviors in a mobile context. Users navigate realistic mobile security challenges, such as identifying phishing attempts in SMS messages, configuring secure app settings, and managing permissions effectively. The goal is to deepen users' understanding of mobile-specific threats while equipping them with practical, hands-on skills to mitigate risks in a dynamic and immersive learning environment.

**Development Platform:** Mobile SETA is developed using the Unity game development engine. Unity is selected for its robust development capabilities, scalability, and cross-platform support. Unity’s advanced 3D and 2D frameworks enable the creation of immersive and realistic training scenarios that enhance user engagement and learning outcomes. Unity also facilitates the integration of gamified features to further improve user engagement and support diverse experimental conditions. Unity’s modular architecture supports easy scalability, making it easy to implement future updates and add new training modules as needed. Additionally, Unity allows deployment across multiple platforms, including iOS, Android, web, and desktop, ensuring that Mobile SETA is accessible to a wide audience.
